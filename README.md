# Training, Selection, and Testing of Used Car Price Prediction Models

## Overview
This notebook performs the steps of training, selecting, and testing a model to predict the price of used cars in Vietnam. The main goal is to build a regression model to predict car prices based on key features such as:

- **Brand**: Reflects the importance of the brand.
- **Car Age**: Older cars tend to have lower prices.
- **Engine Capacity**: Cars with larger engines are often more expensive.
- **Drivetrain**: The type of drivetrain affects the car's value.
- **Body Style**: Popular or premium body styles tend to increase the price.
- **Mileage**: Cars with higher mileage usually have lower prices.
- **Car Model**: The car model name has a strong correlation with price.

The data used in this project is analyzed from a midterm exam and stored in the file `rawdata.csv`.

## Main Content
The notebook includes the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Read data from the `rawdata.csv` file, clean, and normalize the data.
2. **Model Building**: Train different regression models to predict car prices.
3. **Model Selection**: Compare the performance of the models and select the best one.
4. **Model Testing**: Evaluate the model on the test dataset.

## How to Run the Program
1. **Set up the environment**:
   - Ensure Python (version >= 3.7) is installed.

2. **Prepare the data**:
   - Update the file path to the dataset in the second code cell of the notebook.

3. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute each cell sequentially to complete the steps.

4. **Results**:
   - The final result will be the best car price prediction model along with its performance evaluation.

## Notes
- If you encounter errors during execution, check the installed libraries and the dataset file path.
- Read the comments in the notebook carefully to understand each step.
